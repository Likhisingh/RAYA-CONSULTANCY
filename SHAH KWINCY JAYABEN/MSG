I am Shah Kwincy Jayaben, a  
Bachelor of  computer science Semester 2 student at Lj university.My sister was supporting my education, but after her marriage, it has become difficult to pay my fees. I don’t have a father, and my mother’s business is currently unstable.

I would be very grateful for any kind of support, such as a fee concession or scholarship, so I can continue my studies.

Thank you ☺
